# Data-Augmentation
🌸 Image Data Augmentation with TensorFlow & Keras
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates data augmentation techniques on the TensorFlow Flowers Dataset
.
Data augmentation is a critical step in deep learning workflows, helping improve model generalization by artificially increasing dataset size through transformations such as rotation, flipping, cropping, zooming, and brightness adjustments.

The notebook walks through:

Downloading and preparing the dataset

Visualizing flower images

Applying data augmentation techniques

Preparing augmented data for deep learning models

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.8+

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

Matplotlib

NumPy

PIL (Pillow)

🚀 Installation & Setup

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-augmentation.git
cd data-augmentation

🖼️ Sample Visualizations

Original vs Augmented Images:

Original	Augmented
🌹 Rose	🌹 Rotated/Zoomed
🌻 Sunflower	🌻 Brightened/Flipped
🎯 Use Cases

Improves image classification models

Reduces overfitting by diversifying training data

Useful in small dataset scenarios

📌 Future Work

Train a CNN on augmented dataset

Compare model accuracy with vs without augmentation

Deploy as a data preprocessing pipeline for image datasets
